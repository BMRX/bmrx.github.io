Design Theory & Thoughts

- Navigation

    First things first, I have no idea how to do the navigation. I was thinking about doing a bottom bar navigation. It would be always stuck to the bottom and would scroll with the page. The more I think about it and the more I use it, the less sense it makes. I love the idea but it just doesn't work for a website. I still want to do SOMETHING with it though, having the content "framed" by a stuck top and bottom bar just resonates with me. So what do I do with the bottom bar?

    A proper footer comes to mind, copyright, socials, contact, sitemap, etc. I can make the footer expand on click. It's a neat idea.

    Another idea is the bottom bar could actually be a contextual menu based on the content. Honestly though this idea really only works for a photo gallery. The bottom bar can extend up to give a description of the photo. For everything else though it's kind of useless.

- Layout & Purpose

    I'm actually struggling with this a bit.

    My thoughts are the site will be a blog/portfolio/place to show off the stuff I find neat.
    Gunpla builds, coding projects, etc.

    But I want the home page to have some cool shit on it. I just don't have anything cool to put there right now, so I'm finding hard to visualize what the final product will be.

- Structure

    Here is what I know - the site will absolutely have 3 types of content.

    1: Journal - This is just my ramblings about whatever, no specific content.
    2: Builds - Sometimes I build stuff, raspberry pi projects, gunpla, woodworking, anything that I build with my hands and is more involved. This is again just a blog, but I want a clear distinction between the two.
    3: Projects - These are more computer centric, website designs, coding adventures, etc. Again a blog, but the way this content is displayed is very different from the Journal content.

    Outside of those three, I have no clue lol.
